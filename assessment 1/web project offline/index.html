        <div class="textbox">
          Code on demand is a very abstract concept due to the variety of its
          scope. In distributed computing, this is widely described as a
          technology that sends executable software codes from server to
          client device based on the client's request. Code on demand could be
          a process which an end-user loads a whole single web application such
          as scanning the QR code presented on the What's App web application.
          It could also be described as a process that the user calls a
          function from to execute a code on-demand, the executable code may
          be triggered by the user's click on the page to load data or do
          something else.
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
          Code on demand is a method to deliver scripts from server side to
          end user side by using automated scripts triggered by end users.
          When a script requested by user's actions such as clicking,
          hovering, or scrolling, the script will be loaded as an executable
          code from the server side, and it runs on the end user device to
          achieve certain object, for example animation, uploading data, and
          loading web-based application etc. Many implementations can achieve
          this feature including JavaScript, FlashPlayer by Adobe, and
          ActionScript etc. The most advanced way to implement code on demand
          is to use WebAssembly, which allows webs to run binary code and has
          better performance comparing with JavaScript.

          Many years ago, when Adobe FlashPlayer used to be a major method to
          present the multi-media elements on webpages after the failure of
          Java applets, it implemented this technology to load content based
          on the user's demand. This includes web animations and widgets, simple
          applications and games etc. However, as the world began to give up
          on Adobe FlashPlayer in 2017, the majority of web browsers started
          to encourage developers and users to use HTML5 as a standard to
          replace FlashPlayer. The Increase in Internet bandwidth and client
          devices' performance created a massive demand for webpage design and
          development. Nowadays the application of code on demand are mainly
          used in the following aspects in webpage development:

                The concept of code on demand helps developer to achieve
                dynamically updated webpages and attractive interactions via
                JavaScript based frameworks such as Vue, Angular, WebAssembly
                and React. For example, users do not need to go to another
                link to browse additional contents. Instead, the webpage and
                its background scripts load these contents and update the page
                for the user.

                As end users' demanding, webpages and applications become so
                fancy and power to use. The expansion of web applications
                requires massive bundle to support them to run, especially if
                the developer imports a large third-party repository without
                using CDN for some reason. End users need to wait a long
                period to load if the packed application is too large. Code
                splitting is a good solution to prevent this happening by
                achieve “lazy loading” to only load necessary parts. So, the
                concept of code on demand improves the flexibility.

                Traditional webpages are created by server-side templates, and
                they are delivered as rendered html files from server by
                user's request. In comparison, webpages using code on demand
                concept significantly reduces the server-side workload by
                giving rendering tasks to client side. Additionally, the
                client-side device only loads requested items and contents by
                user's action. This also saves client-side resources by
                avoiding unnecessarily loading useless files and scripts.

                As a characteristic of this concept, code on demand separates
                rendering tasks and providing data. This allows the developer
                to focus on content delivery and script creation separately,
                and it gives the developer huge number of combinations of
                different modules. By only supporting data and contents,
                existing modules can render contents automatically, and the
                developer can easily remove or add a module to update the
                page.

                Due to the increased number of communications between server
                and client because of code on demand concept. Both sides may
                start to show their vulnerability. If the server side does not
                implement anti-XSS (Cross-site scripting) attack, unauthorized
                JavaScript codes running on client side may lead to serious
                security issues. For example, without proper protection, a
                user can easily run his own code on the page. Moreover,
                because the feature of code on demand, webpages using this
                concept will be highly relied on CDN (content delivery
                network) network to render pages. This creates a huge
                security concern regarding the security of CDN security. It is
                hard to count how many potential connections may be
                established between CDNs and end users for a very complicated
                webpage. These potential connections are hidden risks put end
                users and server sides under risks. If contents in CDN are
                intentionally replaced with malicious scripts, it will be very
                hard to manage.

                In the case of dynamically updating the page, the user cannot

                difference between pages that has been read in its entirety
                and one that has been dynamically modified is subtle; users
                will often expect to click the back button to cancel their
                previous action, but with the concept of code on demand, this
                will be very hard to achieve.

            the most advanced WebAssembly, the concept of code on demand leads
            the development of JavaScript to an unprecedented level.

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="textbox">
          The history of code on demand begins from 1995 when Brendan Eich
          invented JavaScript. At that time, almost all webpages were purely
          developed by HTML. Because of stateless, webpages refreshes
          whenever the user send requests to the server. To reduce the
          server work load and achieve Asynchronous load, Java applet was
          firstly introduced to run client-side application with Java
          structure. Java applet applications have very limited functions,
          such as displaying an animated logo. End users could send requests to
          server to load such applications to execute via browser. It also has
          good compatibility by being executable on Windows, Unix, and macOS.
          Java applet used to have a pretty run speed because of its 3D
          hardware acceleration. But this advantage became unnoticeable after
          2011 since canvas technology was widely used. After HTML 5.0 was introduced
          in 2014, Java applet started to become unavailable, and it faded out
          after 2017.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
          After the introduction of Flash, Java applet became outdated.
          Because Flash has a very good performance on animation and
          communication with the server at that time. Flash became the only
          way to play large multimedia content on webpages back in 2001 with
          the average bandwidth under 1M. Many applications, medias embedded
          in web pages relied on Flash, and its programming language
          ActionScript also became very popular. At the era of ActionScript 3,
          the performance of Flash enhanced a lot. It tried to develop some
          enterprise-level interactions. Many governments and internet banking
          websites began to use related technologies such as Adobe Flex.
          However, the disadvantages became noticeable by compared with other
          developing technologies, problems such as its security concerns, low
          performance, and bad support for touch devices were hard to adapt
          new requirements. In 2017, Adobe announced it would stop
          supporting flash in 2021.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox w3-border-bottom" id="anchor">
          The existence of these technologies made the development environment
          chaotic in early 2000's. In 2010, Steven Jobs published a discussion
          about problems of Flash. After that, Flash and other similar
          platforms started losing markets because of HTML5. In comparison,
          HTML5 have much better compatibility on mobile devices. Additional
          to that, WebSockets and LocalStorage combining with CSS made HTML5
          possible to handle complex website and applications with no security
          compromise.
