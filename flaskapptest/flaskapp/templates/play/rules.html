  <p>Moving a tile counts as one round. </p>
  <p>You can move tiles as far as you want; the only limitation is a time limit of 8 seconds. Before moving a tile, you
    can think as long as you want (even closing the app and coming back later). As soon as you begin moving, the timer
    will count down, and you must finish your move within 7 seconds.</p>
  <p>When you move a tile, it will swap positions with the tile it moves toward, just like in traditional match-three
    games. However, in this game you can move as far as you want instead of being limited to one square, so you can drag
    your tile all over the board to create multiple matches.</p>
  <p>Tiles can be swapped diagonally, but it's difficult to pull off. It's easier on larger screens, but still very
    touchy.</p>
  <p>Matching rules are the same as in other match-three games. Any 3-in-a-row tiles of the same colour will disappear.
    The more tiles you clear at once, the higher the combo and score caused. </p>
