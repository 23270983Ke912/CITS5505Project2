## 1. Introduction
This game was inspired by a popular mobile game called Puzzle & Dragons.

This game is very similar to candy crush, or other similar match-of-three games.

However, the only difference between this game and other match-of-three games is that this game does not restrict you from moving the tile 1 block away from its original position. Instead, you can move your selected tile anywhere you want in the box. During your move, the tile you moved will automatically swap the position with the tile on that direction of the movement. Therefore, you can create as many as combo as possible.
The score board of the game will record the tile you eliminated and the max combo you made.
Have a try! You can also save you result on your desktop for you to share it with your friends!


## 2. Rules
2.1.  Moving a tile counts as one round.

2.2. You can move tiles as far as you want; the only limitation is a time limit of 8 seconds. Before moving a tile, you can think as long as you want (even closing the app and coming back later). As soon as you begin moving, the timer will count down, and you must finish your move within 8 seconds.

2.3. When you move a tile, it will swap positions with the tile it moves toward, just like in traditional match-three games. However, in this game you can move as far as you want instead of being limited to one square, so you can drag your tile all over the board to create multiple matches.
2.4. Tiles can be swapped diagonally, but it's difficult to pull off. It's easier on larger screens, but still very touchy.

2.5. Matching rules are the same as in other match-three games. Any 3-in-a-row tiles of the same colour will disappear. The more tiles you clear at once, the higher the combo and score caused.

2.6. After 3 rounds, you can choose to share your score to the score board by clicking the share button. Your play result will be downloaded as PNG image. So you can save the result and share with your friends.

## 6. Functions and Features
6.1. The original game source code is created by mrmu. Link is here: https://github.com/mrmu/tos_puzzle_js

6.2. The flask app is created by blueprint.

6.3. The app comes with user system, admin system( allow admins to change user account type, delete user accounts, edit puzzle, save puzzle for later updates.)

6.4. The scoreboard function records previous playsâ€™ results, including username, score, max combo, and the date (shared by users to the public). Moreover, when an admin accesses this page, the scoreboard page becomes an activity log, It displays not only user shared scores, but also the unshared scores which are generated automatically after a game finished.
